This is a top-down maze-navigation game about a trick-or-treater exploring their neighborhood on Halloween night to collect candy. While doing so, the player is pursued by a bully who will steal their candy if they’re caught. Early levels feature a single bully, but both the maze difficulty and the bully’s behavior become more challenging as the game progresses. The number of houses the player must visit doubles each level, except for the final two stages.

The core challenge is to navigate each maze, collect candy from every required house, and avoid being caught. There are no power-ups or character upgrades, success relies entirely on player skill and the ability to adapt to changing level layouts and the increasingly aggressive pursuer.

What sets this game apart from similar titles, such as Pac-Man, is that the player cannot fight back against the bully, the setting is more realistic, and the theme revolves around Halloween. Although the game may have a slightly spooky tone, it is not a horror game. This makes it accessible to players who dislike horror while still appealing to those looking for a Halloween-themed experience. While it may have limited appeal to older teens and adults, it could be particularly attractive to a younger, child-focused audience.
